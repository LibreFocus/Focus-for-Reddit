**Focus for Reddit Content Filters**
(for Ublock Origin, Adguard, Brave, etc.)

These filter lists are designed to remove many distraction prone elements of Reddit so that you can use the website for productivity.

The light version is compatible with Ublock Origin as it contains procedural filters. Procedural filters more easily allows custom blocking, such as blocking elements only on specific subdomains. The light version will block things like the front page, r/popular, r/all, related posts, side panels, as well as top bars and logo buttons that bring you to the front page or distraction subreddits. You can remove subreddits by removing their respective line in the Old Reddit section and the New Reddit section. Similarly, you can add additional subreddits by following the same syntax.

The strict version will block similar things to the light version, but is designed for two use cases.
1. It is designed for browsers that have built-in basic cosmetic content filtering like Brave Browser, but that don't support procedural filtering extensions. This will be most valuable for Brave for Android users since that browser version does not support extensions.
2. It is designed for people who do not want to browse or surf reddit, but want to be able to access Reddit results from search engines. It will block all subreddit feeds, but not their comment sections, which is what will appear in search results.

3. You should still be able to login and post normally on both versions.
